# üåê Webhook: A Secure Multi-Tenant Webhook System

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/releases-v1.0.0-blue)

Welcome to the **Webhook** repository! This project provides a secure, multi-tenant webhook system that can operate using in-memory storage, Redis, or Kafka. It features exponential backoff for retry strategies, ensuring reliable message delivery in distributed systems.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Handle multiple clients with ease.
- **Storage Options**: Choose between in-memory, Redis, or Kafka.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry failed webhooks intelligently.
- **Encryption**: Secure your data with RSA encryption.
- **Partitioning**: Efficiently manage message distribution with Kafka.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Grafana for real-time metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Webhook system, follow the instructions below. You will need Deno installed on your machine. If you haven't done so, please visit the [Deno website](https://deno.land) for installation instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Deno (version 1.0 or higher)
- Redis or Kafka (if using these as storage options)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronixa/webhook.git
cd webhook
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --unstable main.ts
```

## Usage

To start the Webhook system, run the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --unstable main.ts
```

You can now send webhooks to the system. Here‚Äôs an example of how to send a webhook using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"event": "user_signup", "data": {"user_id": "12345"}}'
```

### Webhook Payload Structure

The webhook payload should be in JSON format. Here‚Äôs a sample structure:

```json
{
  "event": "event_name",
  "data": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

You can configure the Webhook system using environment variables. Here are the available options:

- `WEBHOOK_PORT`: The port on which the webhook server will listen (default: 8000).
- `STORAGE_TYPE`: The storage type to use (`memory`, `redis`, or `kafka`).
- `REDIS_URL`: The URL for the Redis server (required if using Redis).
- `KAFKA_BROKER`: The address of the Kafka broker (required if using Kafka).
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: The RSA key for encrypting webhook data.

### Example Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
WEBHOOK_PORT=8000
STORAGE_TYPE=redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Architecture

The Webhook system follows a microservices architecture. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview:

1. **Webhook Receiver**: Listens for incoming webhook requests.
2. **Message Queue**: Uses Redis or Kafka for message queuing.
3. **Worker**: Processes the queued messages and sends them to the appropriate endpoint.
4. **Monitoring**: Integrates with Grafana for real-time monitoring.

## Monitoring

Integrate with Grafana to visualize the performance of your webhook system. You can set up dashboards to monitor:

- Incoming webhook requests
- Processing times
- Success and failure rates

To set up monitoring, ensure you have Grafana installed and connect it to your data source.
